# DistributedPulseModulation

Distributed pulse modulation done like with the old P82C150, but with descrete components

## Theory of operation

With a regular Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), all the pulses are grouped in a same and unique pulse over the whole period.
On Distributed Pulse Modulation (DPM) and Dyadic Descrete Pulse Modulation (DDPM), the aim is to distribute all the "sub-pulses" throughout the whole period.

## Two advantages :
* spectrum with more high frequencies than PWM : easier filtering in case of A/D conversion
* as the pulse distribution is continuously evaluated : a threshold modification, before the period end, is taken into account without delay

### MCP23017 Port A & B

	MCP23017 is an I2C 16bits IO expander
	Port A & B are used to control the board
	Prescaler decoding values :
	0x00	1
	0x01	2
	0x02	8
	0x03	16
	0x04	64
	0x05	256
	0x06	1024
	0x07	4096
